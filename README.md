# HRCInvestments
A scraped dataset from the HRC NZ website showing where investments have been made.

This was done in Feb 2022 from the HRC website using a browser scraper. I have done some work to cleanse the data and have described this from a research perspective and from a researcher perspective.

There are a few wrinkles with the data:

1. The data reflects when the award was made, I have added from project pages the length of the grants, but it assumes planned = actual
2. There was a big change in 2019 where more than two researchers were added to the available data
3. The order of the researhers listed reflects seniority (it doesn't appear to have another sort order I can see).

Some things I am interested in (but haven't done yet) are:

1. Links to publications from these researchers - how productive are the investments.
2. How the networks of researchers form and can we see how these researchers grow over time in terms of role.
